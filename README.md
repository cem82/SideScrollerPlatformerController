# SideScrollerPlatformerController
Currently I don't have time to make new games so I'm releasing this prototype that I've made for Side Scroller Characters.

It includes things like Jump Buffering, coyote time etc.

CollisionCheck script is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcw6nuc2uaU this tutorial. Back then I used this code in an another prototype but with this one I used my own scripts except CollisionCheck.
